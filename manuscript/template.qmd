# Introduction

This [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) [template](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/formats.html) generates a PDF that is:

- Double spaced
- With 12 point text (including in footnotes!)
- With one-inch margins
- Using Times New Roman as the main font
- Using Helvetica for section headings
- Optionally anonymized
- Optionally has double-spaced footnotes (as required by, e.g. [The Journal of Politics](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/toc/jop/current))

These choices are compatible with the submission requirements of a large number of (at least political science) journals.

# References

No particular reference style is suggested or enforced by this template, that's up to you to select based either on personal preference or journal requirements.
